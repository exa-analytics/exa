"""
The purpose of this package is to provide a framework for reading data from disk,
organizing this data into related, systematic, and efficient data structures, and
attaching these data structures to a container to allow visualization and other
interactive exploration within the `Jupyter notebook`_. The following is a compact
summary.

- editors: Classes that facilitate creation of data containers
- data: Classes that facilitate data visualization via the container
- containers: Flexible device for processing, analyzing and visualizing data

Complete documentation is available on the web https://exa-analytics.github.io/exa/.
The following is a brief description of the source code structure, which may aid
in usage.

Warning:
    The ``_static`` directory in the source code contains static data. It does
    not contain Python or other source code files and is not importable. It is
    included as 'package_data'.

Note:
    Tests are always located in the ``tests`` directory of each package or
    sub-package.
