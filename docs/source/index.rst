*A framework for data management, processing, and visualization.*

This package provides a data management, processing, analytics, and
visualization framework built atop of the `PyData`_ stack. Although it is the
main dependency of packages tailored to specific data industries, it can also
be used in a standalone fashion for data management, exploration, and
visualization, and is especially useful where relationships between discrete
(and/or analytical) data sets are present.
